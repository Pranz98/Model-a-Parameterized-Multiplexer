Overview :
This project involves the design and verification of a parameterized multiplexer using SystemVerilog. The project demonstrates the ability to create a flexible hardware module that can be configured for different bit-widths and validates its functionality through a comprehensive testbench. The project is an excellent example of using hardware description languages for digital design and showcases skills in both coding and verification of digital circuits.

Project Objectives :
1. Designed a parameterized multiplexer using SystemVerilog.
2. Created a testbench to verify the functionality of the multiplexer.
3. Simulated the design and validate the results using Cadence XCELIUM.
